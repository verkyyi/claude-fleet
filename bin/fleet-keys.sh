#!/bin/bash
# fleet-keys.sh — the fleet keymap cheatsheet (issue #110). One curated source
# of truth for EVERY fleet shortcut, grouped by context:
#   tmux prefix binds · dashboard fzf · backlog fzf · config modal fzf.
#
# Opened by `prefix ?` (display-popup -E; see conf/tmux-attention.conf) and by a
# `?` bind inside the dash/backlog. The popup closes on q/esc.
#
# Usage:
#   fleet-keys.sh            # print the sheet, then wait for q/esc (popup mode)
#   fleet-keys.sh --plain    # print once and exit (no wait) — for pipes / tests
#                            #   also implied when stdout is not a tty
#
# Drift guard: bin/fleet-keys-selftest.sh cross-checks the keys listed here
# against the binds actually shipped in conf/tmux-attention.conf + the dash/
# backlog fzf --binds, so this sheet can't silently go stale.
